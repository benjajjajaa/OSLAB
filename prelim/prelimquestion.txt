1.  Using Cpp code Prelim.cpp using cpp language do a code that you can you as execute algorithm
1. Using C++ make a code that can run Round Robin, Shortest Job First, Shortest Remainting Time First Algorithm.
the variable should be in structure named process. it should calculate quantum time in round robin, and should calculate median of burst time to calculate quantum time.
in main code the arrival and burst time is already declared. the order of the result is: time quantum for the round robin, Round Robin, SJF, SRTF, int main.

the given are:
at = 4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 8, 7
bt = 53, 43, 18, 16, 44, 73, 99, 27


the diplay of table result should look like this:
PID  AT  BT  Completion  TT  WT

add average TT and average WT for each table


fix the result table, fix the alignment and add some "-------" design so the results dont scramble. and add the calculate of time quantum, how you got it.
