//program that implement system calls with function of fork and PID and using system call wait. it must show 3 PID in one run using the fork.
//first come first serve simulation where, it can display Average turn around time and average waiting time. that can process 10 process the burst time, the burst time are 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 8, 1
//implement a shortest job first that can hold 5 process. the burst time are 50.54, 10.11, 33.34, 2.5, 101.1 
//round robin with time quantum as 20.
